# KSP-Fwiffo-Repository
This is a CKAN (Comprehensive Kerbal Archive Network) repository of Kerbal Space Program mods, originally created for Fwiffo's personal use.  It includes KSP 1.1-compatible, development / experimental versions of several popular mods, which (at the time of writing) are newer than what is available in other repositories.

Eventually it will also include other tweaks / customizations further described in the metadata.

No guarantees are made, and this repository will likely NOT be kept up to date over the long term.  Once KSP 1.1 graduates from beta testing, be sure to check for newer, official versions of mods in the main CKAN repositories before installing anything from here.
