// Fwiffo's Toroid Nozzle Tank
// Version: 1 (2016-Aug-15)
//
// DESCRIPTION:
//
//   This scaled up version of the ROUND-8 Toroidal Tank mounts on top of a Poodle
//   engine, and stores LFO in a ring around the exhaust manifold.  Note real spacecraft
//   pump fuel through lines spiraling up the exhaust vent, in order to cool the manifold
//   and preheat the fuel.  This part also helps to lower your CoM, which can be handy for
//   landers.
//
// NOTES:
//
//   If you need to further lower the CoM, simply adjust all the Y values in this file or
//   use CoMOffset).
//
//   The stock toroidal tank has inner radius 0.3125m, outer radius 0.576m and is 0.331m tall
//   (note dimensions are approximate).  It weight 0.0375t (dry mass) and holds 27 liquid
//   fuel (0.135t) and 33 oxidizer (0.165t).  Volume is approximately 0.2 cubic metres (0.14
//   if it were a perfect toroid, but it's stretched vertically so it's actually more of an
//   Elliptic Torus - see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticTorus.html).
//   The scaled part volume is roughly 3 cubic metres (15x more) - actually a little more now
//   since the part was enlarged slightly since these calculations, for cosmetics.  It would
//   hold ~ 405 liquid fuel if scaled linearly from ROUND-8 part, but this is way too much
//   considering the X200-8 tank looks bigger in game and only holds 360 liquid fuel.  Also
//   the Fwiffo Toroidal Tank 8x (which is slightly smaller) holds 216 liquid fuel.
//   So, arbitrarily make this one hold ~ 2/3 of X200-8 = 240 liquid fuel, minus 6 to round
//   the total for the entire weldment to 1170 which makes for a nice even 1430 oxidizer at
//   the 9:11 ratio.
//
//   i.e. This tank holds 234 liquid fuel and 286 oxidizer.
//   LFO tanks in KSP all have a constant ratio of 720 liquid fuel units per ton of dry mass
//   (0.0125 tons wet mass per unit of liquid fuel) and both liquid fuel and oxidizer are
//   0.005 t / unit.
//
//   Thus dry mass of this tank is 0.325 tons, it holds 1.17t of liquid fuel, 1.43t of oxidizer
//   and total wet mass is 2.925 tons.
//
//   Note both attachment nodes are in the same spot, so that the poodle always attaches where
//   it ordinarily would go (i.e. at the bottom of the on the part above this one).
//
//   For cosmetics, the attachment nodes are positioned along the Y axis such that the poodle
//   hides the texture seam artifact visible on the top portion of the tank.  The tank is
//   vertically sized such that it envelops about 3/4 of the exhaust manifold and the black
//   braces meet nicely with the edge of the engine.
//
// CHANGELOG:
//
//   2016-Aug-15: Initial release (experimental)
//
// LICENSE:
//
//   Use this however the heck you want.  I'm not responsible for any consequences!
